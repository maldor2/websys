Part1: The page loads faster because instead of adding the event to each li, it checks the tagName and if it is an li it hides it.

Part2:
O1. To get color instead of using a url just set a color of light green in the style part. This got alot faster becuase before the page would have to go and find the URL and get that color.

O2. make an array for the hidden points then forshow all show the values in the array.

Creativity 1: Change the color of the clicked font to red then hide the li so when show all is clicked you can see the ones you clicked away in red.
